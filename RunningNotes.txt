Basically rest api is consumed and returned in JSON
if we need to get XML then use a jar jackson-dataformat-xml in POM. (Accept application/xml as header)
 
HATEOAS is useful for sending links in JSON.

Dynamic filtering is for some requests you want to send some fields and for other requests you dont.
Mapping Jackson Value can do this.

Verisoning an API
URI Versioning:  /v1/person , /v2/person
Params: @GetMapping(value = "/person/header", params= "version=1") and pass params
Headers: @GetMapping(value = "/person/header", headers= "X-API-VERSION=1") and pass that header
Content Negotiation: @GetMapping(value = "/person/header", produces= "application/api-v1+json") and pass that header as Accept: application/api-v1+json

Front controller Pattern -> All requests go to the dispatcher Servlet & dispatcher servlet looks at controllers and mappings
and finds the right controller method to execute based on Http Request.

Advantages of spring boot
1. Standalone ready for production (has embedded tomcat).
2. Spring boot autoconfiguration helps a lot (configuring datasource, or converting objects to JSON etc.)
3. Spring boot is opinionated (it says its a good starting point like for database it will do in memory, datasource and hibernate
entity manager but we can always ovveride it).

SOAP -> send xml requests get xml repsonse back
transport: http, MQ
WSDL. (endpoint, all operations, request, response).

REST -> make best use of HTTP. Any request fromat (JSON, XML, HTML)
Browser sends request to server & get response. (URI is a resource).
Swagger only HTTP.

MICROSERVICES
REST
Small Deployable Units
Cloud Enabled (can be scaled dynamically up & down)
Faster release cycles
Microservices can be written in diifferent languages & they can talk to each other.

Naming Server Eureka
Ribbon(Client Side load balancing)
Feign (Easier Rest Client)

Monitoring
Zipkin API Gateway
Netflix Zuul

@ConfigurationProperties can be used for mapping values to POJO from application.yml also useful so we have all our configuration at one place & also use @refreshscope.

environment.getProperty("local.server.port") -> gets the port of app running.

Feign Client: 
add dependency to pom.xml
@EnableFeignClients("package-name")
@FeignClient(name="pao-service", url = "https://localhost:8080")

and then methods will be 
@GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}"
public CurrencyConversionBean retrieveExchangeValue(@PathVariable String from, @PathVariable String to); 

Ribbon -> client side load balancing
Distribute load across multiple instances for example PAO Service has 4 instances, make sure each instance is getting proper
load from TAg Service.
Add dependency to POM.
@FeignClient(name="pao-service")
@RibbonClient(name="pao-service")
pao-service.ribbon.listOfServers=http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8001

EUREKA -> Naming Server
Automatically scale instances up & down based on load
ServiceRegistration -> each app should register with eureka server
ServiceDiscovery -> find the instances of other microservices to call.

Naming Server Code
Start a new Project with dependecy eureka-netflix-server
add application name,port(8761 default), and config properties 
@EnableEurekaServer

TAG Service register with Eureka
Add dependency eureka-client
@EnableDiscoveryClient
eureka.client.service-url.default-zone=http://localhost:8761/eureka (Register with Eureka Naming Server).
//pao-service.ribbon.listOfServers=http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8001 (comment this line so ribbon will start talking to eureka server).

PAO Service register with Eureka
Add dependency eureka-client
@EnableDiscoveryClient
eureka.client.service-url.default-zone=http://localhost:8761/eureka (Register with Eureka Naming Server).
