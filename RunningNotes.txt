Basically rest api is consumed and returned in JSON
if we need to get XML then use a jar jackson-dataformat-xml in POM. (Accept application/xml as header)
 
HATEOAS is useful for sending links in JSON.

Dynamic filtering is for some requests you want to send some fields and for other requests you dont.
Mapping Jackson Value can do this.

Verisoning an API
URI Versioning:  /v1/person , /v2/person
Params: @GetMapping(value = "/person/header", params= "version=1") and pass params
Headers: @GetMapping(value = "/person/header", headers= "X-API-VERSION=1") and pass that header
Content Negotiation: @GetMapping(value = "/person/header", produces= "application/api-v1+json") and pass that header as Accept: application/api-v1+json

Front controller Pattern -> All requests go to the dispatcher Servlet & dispatcher servlet looks at controllers and mappings
and finds the right controller method to execute based on Http Request.

Advantages of spring boot
1. Standalone ready for production (has embedded tomcat).
2. Spring boot autoconfiguration helps a lot (configuring datasource, or converting objects to JSON etc.)
3. Spring boot is opinionated (it says its a good starting point like for database it will do in memory, datasource and hibernate
entity manager but we can always ovveride it).
